# VoyStick (ongoing)

VoyStick is a real-time formant tracking program based on python. The project is still ongoing.

# Features / Purposes
  - Real-time formant tracking (input audio, output formants)
  - Real-time ploting (plot formants)
  - Pronunciation checking (check if the subject hits the right formants/vowels)

# Current Status

  - Input audio, output formants (however, formants inaccurate)
  - Show plot (refining needed)


You may want to:
  - Tune parameters
  - Add calibration
  - Change GUI
  - Add formant detection 

# Code Details
## Structures 
| Folders | Files | Comments |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **debugTools** | | |
| |checkNoise | record a short duration and ouput a plot of signal |
|| current | a class used in formant prediction|
||debugging | take in whether a sample voice file from UCLA lab or a record from the file *record*, output time vs formants plots for f1, f2, f3 and other related plots|
|| formant_predict | a formant predict algorithm (LPC) adapted from demo of MATLAB |
|| *test.wav*| generated by *record* |
|**realtimePlotting**| | |
|| f1f2f3plotting | realtime time vs formants plotting, as 3 subplots of f1, f2, f3|
|| voystick | main program, plotting a dot instead of time vs formants|
|**volumnplotting**| | |
||recording  | create a tape, not used in main part |
|| volumnplot | my first demo of realtime audio plotting |
|**references** | | some might be useful code |
